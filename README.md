# Unhandled JSON Exception in Dart Asynchronous HTTP Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart when handling asynchronous HTTP requests and JSON responses. The code attempts to access the first element of a JSON array without checking for the existence of data or necessary keys.  This can lead to runtime exceptions.

The `bug.dart` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.dart` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.dart`.
3. Observe the exception if the API returns an empty array or lacks expected keys.

## Solution

The solution involves adding comprehensive checks to ensure the data is present and correctly structured before accessing specific elements.  See `bugSolution.dart` for details.  Always validate your JSON data before using its contents to prevent unexpected crashes.
